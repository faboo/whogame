	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>
		The Daleks are chasing you! Move to avoid the Daleks (&#9823;) and get them to crash into each other before they can reach you (&#9731;) so you can make your escape in the Tardis.
	</p>
	<p>
		Move with the arrow keys, keypad keys, or HJKLYUBN keys.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stand still for a turn with the . or 5 key.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a pinch, use your sonic screwdriver to destroy the Daleks adjacent to you with the S key, and teleport to safety with the T key.
	</p>

		<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-st/daleks">"Daleks"</a> was a game for the Atari ST created by Moby Games that I remember fondly. This version of the "Doctor Who game" (as I remember calling it) was created for my own amusement and nolstalgia. I've recreated it as I remember it, filling in the gaps as I went.
