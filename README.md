# The "Doctor Who" Game

["Daleks"](https://www.mobygames.com/game/37061/daleks/) was a game for the Atari ST created by Bloom County Software that I remember fondly. This version of the "Doctor Who game" (as I remember calling it) was created for my own amusement and nolstalgia. I've recreated it as I remember it, filling in the gaps as I went.

Doctor Who and the Daleks copyrights and trademarks belong to the BBC.

This game uses sounds created by nofeedbak[1](https://soundbible.com/1495-Basketball-Buzzer.html), and Mike Koenig[2](http://soundbible.com/1232-Water-Drop-Sound-High.html),[3](http://soundbible.com/642-Splat.html).
